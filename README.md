# Intro
Weather app is a project made by Hsia. It's a challenge asigned by BECODE LIEGE code training center. I have been working on this from 30/04/2021 to 07/05/2021 to practice how to make a basic React project.

# Mission objectives

In this challenge you will use and consolidate your knowledge on:

- A typical AJAX flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results
- DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on the results of the AJAX requests
- Learn to aggregate and parse data fetched from an api
- Everything with a JS library like React.JS or Svelte or a JS framework like Vue.JS or Angular

# The Mission

You have been sent abroad for a 10-month work mission. Your family and friends back home ask you about the weather where you live ALL. THE. TIME.
Enough is enough, you decide to build a small web application for them so that you can free your time to talk about more interesting topics.
